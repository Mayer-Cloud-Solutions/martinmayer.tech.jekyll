Retention of software engineers remains a priority for many businesses, as it's hard to find talented people and it can take a long time to train up someone new. Organisations should align with their employees on what might tempt them to stay but often progression opportunities are a key battleground. By promoting from within, software engineering departments can send a positive message to employees. It proves that the organisation values and invests in its people's professional development‚Äîan action of growth, ushering in a more motivated workforce. I propose a strategy prioritising internal opportunities. That's not to discount the benefit of bringing in new team members when it's the right time. I'll walk through some of the things you should think about as an employer to decide if it's the correct strategy for you.

#### üìà Invest in your People

Enabling the progression of your engineering team is essential to retaining great people. Promoting frequently and hiring internally first is a strategy you should consider, it allows you to:
  - identify and nurture your future leaders
  - develop people who are passionate about your products 
  - create solid and cohesive teams 
  - build upon your employees‚Äô loyalty and dedication to the organisation 

#### üîç Identify Future Leaders

Identifying and nurturing future leaders is critical to building a successful organisation. Regular assessments of employees and discussions about their career paths help. Through these processes, identify those with the potential to become future leaders.

Once you've identified potential, investing in their growth and development is essential. The investment includes providing training, mentorship, and coaching opportunities. Career development plans will guide them towards their goals. Offering opportunities for professional development and advancement helps employees feel valued and noticed. In turn, this leads to better retention rates and increased performance.

#### ü§ù Encourage Engineers

Having a clear progression route for all engineers helps to retain your best talent. It gets them thinking about progression throughout their careers. For engineer roles, you may be able to promote without a vacancy. For example, you might decide that you don't need to limit the number of senior engineers. On the other hand, you are unlikely to need extra key leadership roles. Decide on what's possible and make that as clear as you can. 

Having review points throughout the year will help you avoid a big-bang annual review. Of course, you'll need senior leadership to buy into and fund a continual process. If practical, it spreads the work out for managers. More importantly, it gives more opportunities to individuals. There's less pressure to get the conversation right the first time. We should acknowledge that mistakes happen and frequency mitigates the impact. It also supports people in progressing at their own pace. 

#### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë People and Progression

For a senior engineering position, you may favour external candidates to fill the position. You might value a fresh perspective, or perhaps the role has risk attached. Yet, promoting from within fosters loyalty and motivation among employees. If you open the role to internal candidates, it's crucial to conduct the hiring process effectively. Managers should contact employees who have expressed an interest in the position. Have open and honest conversations. Provide feedback on the skills and behaviours required. Offer support to help them develop those skills. Clearly articulate the competencies and behaviours that the candidate must possess now. What can be learned along the way? Ensure that employees understand what you expect of them. Then can collaborate on understanding the required competencies.

Clarity is key. Establish clear criteria and guidelines for selecting candidates. The selection process should prioritise internal candidates. Give them a equitable and impartial opportunity to apply. In cases where it is necessary to hire external candidates, you can think about improving opportunities. The role should include developing talented individuals as potential successors. You'll likely expect this new person to support the progression of your internal team. Make sure that *"coaching and mentoring future leaders"* is on the job description.

#### üí∏ Salary Expectations

I hope you are transparent about the salary range for each role. Openness inspires much trust as long as what you're sharing is defensible. Ensure you have great conversations about why there is a salary range and provide feedback on what improvements you require from them to move them along the scale. Plan to address any discrepancies and ensure managers are calibrating their decisions. Be at least as open with your existing team about pay as with external candidates, or risk losing great staff. Remember, people will talk about their wages (no matter what you would like), so be fair about how you reward your engineers.

#### üèÜ Reward Persistent Effort

Demystify the process for internal and external applicants alike. Be deliberate, consistent and fair in the way you hire people. Make it clear what you want from candidates and how the hiring process will work for them. Most importantly, set out what will happen if they're not ready for the role or you find a more suitable candidate.

What will happen if their application is unsuccessful?

For external applicants:
- Will they get feedback? 
- When can they apply again? 

For internal applicants:
- Who will give them feedback?
- How can they be supported in future applications?
- What opportunities do they have to learn missing skills or gain valuable experience?
- Can you articulate whether they were considered unready for the position?
- If they were ready, was there a more suitable candidate?

#### üë©‚Äçüéì Enabling People Outside of their Current Roles

There are many things that can be done to support people gaining work experience and learning opportunities on something other than their current role. Many of these will need buy-in from other departments but small experiments can be undertaken by Engineering without significant impact. Here are a few options to consider:

- **Shadowing** - Allow engineers to shadow people in other roles - in some cases this will put people off a role rather than encourage them but this is useful information towards their career development and helps them find their pathway
-**Learning and Development Time** - Aim for dedicated Learning and Development time each week so that people have an uninterupted opportunity to sharpen their skills
- **People Development** - Make people development a core responsibility of line managers so that the current role doesn't get in the way of opportunity - it can be easy for managers to prioritise current requirements and other operational concerns over someone's career journey
- **One to One Mentoring** - Set up one to one mentoring so people can network with someone who's further along the pathway - reverse mentoring can also be useful (for example, a senior manager wants to learn how some of the services work from an engineer) as both parties gain from the interaction, the engineer getting to work with someone who can later guide them in their role
- **Peer Mentoring** - Set up a peer mentoring scheme for engineers to support each other in their careers and learn essential skills at the same time

#### ‚ùó Caution around Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

Hiring internally first can be a great way to ensure current employees get the opportunities they deserve. However, it's not a panacea for perfect progression. Promoting internal candidates without considering external people can be problematic. It can harm diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts, especially if you have existing challenges. To avoid this, you should create a diverse and inclusive work environment. Put in place strategies to attract and retain diverse talents. Consider inclusive job descriptions, unconscious bias training, and diversity-focused employee resource groups. Additionally, organisations should examine their hiring practices. Check they are not biased towards promoting certain groups over others. Have clear and objective criteria for promotions. Ongoing process assessments audit that internal opportunities do not harm DEI efforts. 

#### ‚ù§Ô∏è Credible and Empathetic Leaders

Regarding engineering leadership positions, favouring candidates with a software engineering background is precious. Their technical skills and experience will enable them to make better decisions for their team. It also helps them appear credible and quickly build reputation and trust. Experience in the engineer role will also help them empathise with the people they will lead. When you're impacting others with your decisions, you must understand them.

Only certain people want or have the skills to be a manager. It's unprofessional and unkind to place someone unsuitable. You need people with high emotional intelligence. Also, they need the willingness to balance the needs of their reports and the business when making decisions. It's not the right move for everyone; even then, the timing has to be suitable for that person.

Leadership roles are not all equal and need distinct skill sets. Equipping a technical (individual contributor) track and a manager track will give you more options. It allows people to lead differently. For example, someone might be uncomfortable with the people development aspects. There is often crossover but you can align roles broadly to one side or the other in many cases. **Engineering Manager** and **Head/Director of Engineering** on one side. **Staff Engineer** and **Solutions Architect** on the other. Supporting different pathways allows people to feel more comfortable as they move into leadership roles.

#### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Consider a Progression Framework

An engineering progression framework is a structured set of guidelines and expectations. The framework defines the skills, competencies, and experiences. It describes what is needed for engineers to advance in their careers. It outlines the knowledge, responsibilities, and behaviours required for each level of advancement. Enabling employees to understand how to develop their careers and what the business expects from them. If written correctly, the framework can provide a clear career path for employees. It can guide equitable and consistent promotions and create a more motivated and engaged workforce. However, you can't bake in diversity, equity and inclusion, so ensure that what you publish supports your efforts to offer the same opportunity to everyone.

With a published progression framework, businesses can provide clear guidance. What skills and experience are necessary for advancement? How will you measure success so they can progress? The framework can help prepare both managers and individual contributors for their roles. It will help them make a smooth transition into their new positions or prepare for the future. By proposing a path for growth and development, organisations prove commitment to their employees. They increase employee motivation and job satisfaction. They will more often retain team members seeking growth opportunities. Decide whether the framework is a loose guide or rigid levelling tool. You need to ensure all managers use it in the same way and calibrate with each other so the outcomes are fair to all.

#### üôå Support in the role

From day one, have regular review points to be sure the people promoted, and those they work with, are well-supported. It's common for people recently in a new role to feel vulnerable and grateful for the opportunity. Imposter syndrome can kick in, making them anxious about asking for help as they don't want to draw attention to gaps in their skills. Make it easy for them to ask by normalising training needs and offering mentorship with approachable advocates. People are much more likely to succeed if they know they're not alone, and businesses expect a steady learning curve. Listen to the people they work with a deliver fast feedback around any issues to the individual, without assuming and apportioning blame. Put them at ease by helping them make small corrections as they go.

Progression success is not guaranteed. The move can lead to unexpected outcomes for the business and the individual:
- they are not as ready as you all thought they were
- situations outside of work mean they now can't commit
- the role isn't enjoyable for them, and they want a way back

As awkward as it can be to make another change, it will only be worse to leave it for longer. You don't always need to return people to their previous roles. Often there's an alternate role that still gives them the progression they sought. Promptly mitigate the impact of a promotion that doesn't work out. Correct the issue as soon as possible and support everyone involved.

#### üî¨ Case Studies

A lot is changing at the moment in the world of tech. Recent job losses at companies like Alpha and Microsoft can be scary to read. However, there are still great examples of employers focusing on personal development. There are many organisations helping engineers and tech leaders develop their careers. It's not only large businesses that do this. Their stories are often easier to find, with the budgets to promote themselves. üôèPlease comment if you're aware of other examples.

#### üí° Summary

In conclusion, promoting internal candidates is a great way to encourage future leaders. By investing in the development of employees, you can build a motivated workforce. Establishing clear criteria and guidelines for selecting candidates is essential. By offering opportunities for professional advancement, you'll create an open, productive work environment. As noted, it requires care to support diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. For engineering leadership positions, it's critical to assess both technical and interpersonal capabilities. Offering a clear progression framework can ensure a smooth transition into new roles. Promoting from within can help create a strong and cohesive team. That, in turn, will increase employee motivation and retention, leading to organisational success.
