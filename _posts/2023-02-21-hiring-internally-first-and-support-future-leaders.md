#### üîç Identify Future Leaders

Identifying and nurturing future leaders is a critical aspect of building a successful organisation. Employers should look for employees who have a strong work ethic, demonstrate leadership skills, and possess the competencies required for the position. Regular assessments of employees and discussions about their career paths can help identify those with the potential to become future leaders.

Once future leaders have been identified, it's essential to invest in their growth and development. This includes providing training, mentorship, coaching opportunities, and career development plans that guide them towards their goals. Offering opportunities for professional development and advancement helps employees feel valued and invested in, leading to better retention rates and improved performance.

#### ü§ù Encourage Engineers

Having a clear progression route for all engineers, helps you retain your best talent and gets your team thinking about progression throughout their career. If you can manage a continual process, having review points throughout the year will help you avoid a big-bang annual review. It spreads the work out for managers and, more importantly, gives more opportunity for individuals. There's less pressure to get the conversation right first time and supports people progressing at their own pace. For engineer roles, you may be able to promote without a vacancy - for example, you could have more senior engineers than you have now but are unlikely to need additional key leadership roles. Decide on what's possible and make that as clear as you can.

#### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë People and Progression

When hiring for a senior engineering position, it's common to consider external candidates to fill the position. However, promoting from within fosters loyalty and motivation among employees. If the decision is made to open the position to internal candidates, it's crucial to conduct the hiring process effectively. Clearly articulating the competencies and behaviours that the candidate must possess ensures that employees understand what is expected of them and can work towards developing the required competencies. Managers should have open and honest conversations with employees who have expressed an interest in the position, providing feedback on the skills and behaviours required and offering support to help them develop those skills.

To encourage and support the advancement of internal candidates, you should establish clear criteria and guidelines for selecting candidates, which are communicated to all employees. The selection process should prioritize internal candidates and give them a fair and equitable chance to compete for positions. In cases where it is necessary to consider external candidates, the goal should be to use this as an opportunity to identify and develop potential successors from within. It's likely that you'll expect this new person to support the progression of your internal team so make sure that's on the job description as part of the role.

#### üí∏ Salary Expectations

Hopefully, you're able to be somewhat transparent about the salary range for each role. Sharing a clear range inspires a lot of trust. Ensure you're have great conversations about why someone is where there are on their salary range and what they can do to move along. Be at least as open with your existing team about pay as you are with external candidates or you risk losing great staff. Remember people will talk about their wages (no matter what you would like) so be fair about the way you reward your engineers.

#### üèÜ Reward Persistent Effort

Demystify the process for internal and external candidates alike. Be deliberate, consistent and fair in the way you hire people. Make it really clear what you want from candidates and how the hiring process will work for them. Most importantly, set out what will happen if they're not ready for the role or you find a more suitable candidate. What happens if they aren't successful in their application? For external candidates, will they get feedback and when can they apply again? For internal candidates, who will give them feedback and how can they be supported in future applications? What opportunities do they have to learn missing skills or to gain valuable experience? Can you articulate whether they were considered unready for the position or that they were, but a more suitable candidate was instead offered the role?

#### ‚ö† Caution around Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

Hiring internally first can be a great way to ensure current employees get the opportunities they deserve. However, promoting internal candidates without considering external people too can harm diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts, if the organisation's existing workforce lacks diversity. To avoid this, you should create a diverse and inclusive work environment, implement strategies to attract and retain diverse talent, such as inclusive job descriptions, unconscious bias training, and diversity-focused employee resource groups. Additionally, organisations should examine their hiring practices to ensure that they are not biased towards promoting certain groups over others. Having clear and objective criteria for promotion, along with ongoing assessments of the process, can help ensure that internal promotion does not harm DEI efforts.

#### ‚ù§Ô∏è Credible and Empathetic Leaders

When it comes to engineering leadership positions, it is incredibly valuable to favour candidates with a software engineering background. Their technical skills and experience will not only enable them to make better decisions for their team, it also helps them appear credible and quickly build reputation and trust. This will also help with them to empathise with the teams they'll be leading; when you're impacting so many others with your decisions it's important that you understand their work and their concerns.

Clearly not everyone wants, or has the skills, to be a leader. It's both unprofessional and unkind to the individual and the teams that will report to them, to place someone in a role they're not suitable for. You need people who have high emotional intelligence and willingness to put the needs of their reports and the business before their own when making decisions. It's not the right move for everyone, and certainly isn't right for everyone, at all times.

Providing a technical (individual contributor) track as well as a manager track, will give you more options for career progression within your engineering department and allow people to lead in different ways. For example, someone who isn't comfortable with the people development aspects of an Engineering Manager or Head of Engineering role could be an excellent Staff Engineer or Solutions Architect. Leadership roles are not all equal and need different skillsets.

#### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Consider a Progression Framework

An engineering progression framework is a structured set of guidelines and expectations that define the skills, competencies, and experiences needed for engineers to advance in their career within a software organisation. It outlines the knowledge, responsibilities, and behaviours required for each level of advancement, enabling employees to understand how to develop their careers and what is expected of them. If written correctly, the framework can help to provide a clear career path for employees, ensure equitable and consistent promotions, and create a more motivated and engaged workforce. However, DEI isn't baked in, so ensure what you publish supports your efforts to be fair and inclusive.

With a published progression framework, businesses can provide clear guidelines for what is expected of engineering leaders and what skills and experience are necessary for advancement. This can help prepare both managers and individual contributors for their roles and can make a smooth transition into their new positions. By offering a clear path for growth and development, organisations can demonstrate their commitment to their employees' professional advancement, increase employee motivation and job satisfaction, and retain team members who are seeking growth opportunities.

#### üôå Support in the Role

From day one, have regular review points to be sure the people promoted, and those they work with, are well-supported. It's common for people just promoted to feel vulnerable as well as grateful for the opportunity. Imposter syndrome can kick in making them anxious about asking for help as they don't want to draw attention to gaps in their skills. Make it easy for them to ask by normalising training needs and offer mentorship if possible with approachable advocates. People are much more likely to succeed if they know they're not on their own and the businesses expects a steady learning curve.

It won't always work out though. For everyone's benefit, mitigate the impact of a promotion that doesn't work out by correcting the issue quickly and support everyone involved. The role isn't always what that person expected and the person doesn't always behave how the business would expect. Perhaps they're not as ready as you all thought they were, perhaps situations outside of work means they now can't commit or maybe the role just isn't enjoyable for them and they want a way back - perhaps a mixture. As awkward as it can be to make another change, it will only be worse to leave it longer. You don't always need to return people to their previous role and maybe there's a more suitable role you can assign them that still gives them the progression they were looking for.

#### Case Studies

There's a lot changing at the moment in the world of tech: recent job losses at FAANG (an acronym from Facebook [Meta], Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google/Alpha - pre name changes) can be scary to read but there are still great examples of employers focusing on helping engineers and tech leaders develop their careers. It's not just large businesses who do this but more often their stories are easier to find, with the budgets to promote themselves. Please comment if you're aware of other examples - particularly from smaller employers of software engineers.

#### üëç Summary

In conclusion, recognising, supporting and promoting internal candidates is a great way to identify and nurture future leaders within your existing software engineering department. By investing in the growth and development of employees and offering opportunities for professional advancement, you can build a successful and motivated workforce. It's important to establish clear criteria and guidelines for selecting candidates, prioritize internal candidates, and create an open and productive work environment. As noted, care is required to support (and avoid harming) diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. When it comes to engineering leadership positions, assessing technical skills and leadership capabilities is key, and offering a clear progression framework can ensure a smooth transition into new roles. Ultimately, promoting from within can help create a strong and cohesive team, increase employee motivation and retention, and lead to overall organisational success.
