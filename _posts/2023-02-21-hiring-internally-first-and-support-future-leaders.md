#### üîç Identify Future Leaders

Identifying and nurturing future leaders is critical to building a successful organisation. Regular assessments of employees and discussions about their career paths help identify those with the potential to become future leaders. Employers should look for employees with a strong work ethic, demonstrate leadership skills, and possess the required competencies.

Once you've identified your potential future leaders, investing in their growth and development is essential. The investment includes providing training, mentorship, coaching opportunities, and career development plans that guide them towards their goals. Offering opportunities for professional development and advancement helps employees feel valued and noticed, leading to better retention rates and increased performance.

#### ü§ù Encourage Engineers

Having a clear progression route for all engineers helps retain your best talent and gets your team thinking about progression throughout their careers. Having review points throughout the year will help you avoid a big-bang annual review if you can manage a continual process. It spreads the work out for managers and, more importantly, gives more opportunity to individuals. There's less pressure to get the conversation right the first time, and it supports people progressing at their own pace. For engineer roles, you may be able to promote without a vacancy - for example, you could have more senior engineers than you have now but are unlikely to need additional key leadership roles. Decide on what's possible and make that as clear as you can.

#### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë People and Progression

When hiring for a senior engineering position, it's common to consider external candidates to fill the position. However, promoting from within fosters loyalty and motivation among employees. If you open the role to internal candidates, it's crucial to conduct the hiring process effectively. Managers should have open and honest conversations with employees who have expressed an interest in the position, providing feedback on the skills and behaviours required and offering support to help them develop those skills. Clearly articulating the competencies and behaviours that the candidate must possess ensures that employees understand what you expect of them and can work towards developing the required competencies.

To encourage and support the advancement of internal candidates, you should establish clear criteria and guidelines for selecting candidates, which you should communicate to all employees. The selection process should prioritise internal candidates and give them a fair and equitable chance to compete. In cases where it is necessary to consider external candidates, the goal should be to use this as an opportunity to identify and develop potential successors from within. You'll likely expect this new person to support the progression of your internal team, so make sure that's on the job description as part of the role.

#### üí∏ Salary Expectations

I hope you are transparent about the salary range for each role. Openness inspires much trust as long as what you're sharing is defensible. Ensure you have great conversations about why someone is where their salary is within the range and what they can do to move along. Plan to address any discrepancies and ensure managers are calibrating their decisions. Be at least as open with your existing team about pay as with external candidates, or risk losing great staff. Remember, people will talk about their wages (no matter what you would like), so be fair about how you reward your engineers.

#### üèÜ Reward Persistent Effort

Demystify the process for internal and external applicants alike. Be deliberate, consistent and fair in the way you hire people. Make it clear what you want from candidates and how the hiring process will work for them. Most importantly, set out what will happen if they're not ready for the role or you find a more suitable candidate.

What will happen if their application is unsuccessful?

For external applicants:
- Will they get feedback? 
- When can they apply again? 

For internal applicants:
- Who will give them feedback?
- How can they be supported in future applications?
- What opportunities do they have to learn missing skills or gain valuable experience?
- Can you articulate whether they were considered unready for the position?
- If they were ready, was there a more suitable candidate?

#### ‚ö† Caution around Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

Hiring internally first can be a great way to ensure current employees get the opportunities they deserve. However, it's not a panacea for perfect progression. Promoting internal candidates without considering external people can harm diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts if the organisation's existing workforce, especially if you have existing challenges. To avoid this, you should create a diverse and inclusive work environment and implement strategies to attract and retain diverse talents, such as inclusive job descriptions, unconscious bias training, and diversity-focused employee resource groups. Additionally, organisations should examine their hiring practices to ensure they are not biased towards promoting certain groups over others. Having clear and objective criteria for promotion and ongoing process assessments can help ensure that internal opportunities do not harm DEI efforts.

#### ‚ù§Ô∏è Credible and Empathetic Leaders

Regarding engineering leadership positions, favouring candidates with a software engineering background is precious. Their technical skills and experience will enable them to make better decisions for their team. However, it also helps them appear credible and quickly build reputation and trust. Experience in the engineer role will also help them empathise with the people they'll be leading; when you're impacting so many others with your decisions, you must understand their work and concerns.

Only certain people want or have the skills to be a manager. It's unprofessional and unkind to the individual and the teams that will report to them to place someone unsuitable into a role. It would be best if you had people with high emotional intelligence and willingness to put the needs of their reports and the business before their own when making decisions. It's not the right move for everyone; even then, the timing has to be suitable for that person.

Leadership roles are not all equal and need distinct skill sets. Equipping a technical (individual contributor) track and a manager track will give you more options for career progression within your engineering department and allow people to lead differently. For example, someone uncomfortable with the people development aspects of an Engineering Manager or Head of Engineering role could be an excellent Staff Engineer or Solutions Architect.

#### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Consider a Progression Framework

An engineering progression framework is a structured set of guidelines and expectations that define the skills, competencies, and experiences needed for engineers to advance in their careers within a software organisation. It outlines the knowledge, responsibilities, and behaviours required for each level of advancement, enabling employees to understand how to develop their careers and what you expect from them. If written correctly, the framework can provide a clear career path for employees, ensure equitable and consistent promotions, and create a more motivated and engaged workforce. However, you can't bake in DEI, so ensure that what you publish supports your efforts to be fair and inclusive.

With a published progression framework, businesses can provide clear guidelines for what you expect of their engineering leaders and what skills and experience are necessary for advancement. The framework can help prepare both managers and individual contributors for their roles and can make a smooth transition into their new positions. By proposing a clear path for growth and development, organisations can demonstrate their commitment to their employees' professional advancement, increase employee motivation and job satisfaction, and retain team members seeking growth opportunities.

#### üôå Support in the role

From day one, have regular review points to be sure the people promoted, and those they work with are well-supported. It's common for people recently in a new role to feel vulnerable and grateful for the opportunity. Imposter syndrome can kick in, making them anxious about asking for help as they don't want to draw attention to gaps in their skills. Make it easy for them to ask by normalising training needs and offering mentorship with approachable advocates. People are much more likely to succeed if they know they're not alone, and businesses expect a steady learning curve.

However, progression success is not guaranteed. The move's outcomes can be unexpected for the business and the individual. This person is not as ready as you all thought they were; situations outside of work mean they now can't commit; the role isn't enjoyable for them, and they want a way back. As awkward as it can be to make another change, it will only be worse to leave it for longer. You don't always need to return people to their previous role, and maybe there's a more suitable role you can assign that still gives them the progression they were seeking. For everyone's benefit, mitigate the impact of a promotion that doesn't work out by correcting the issue quickly and supporting everyone involved.

#### üî¨ Case Studies

A lot is changing at the moment in the world of tech: recent job losses at FAANG companies (an acronym from Facebook [Meta], Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google/Alpha - pre-name changes) can be scary to read, but there are still great examples of employers focusing on helping engineers and tech leaders develop their careers. It's not just large businesses who do this; their stories are often easier to find, with the budgets to promote themselves. üôèPlease comment if you're aware of other examples - particularly from smaller employers of software engineers.

#### üí° Summary

In conclusion, recognising, supporting and promoting internal candidates is a great way to identify and nurture future leaders within your existing software engineering department. By investing in the growth and development of employees and offering opportunities for professional advancement, you can build a successful and motivated workforce. Establishing clear criteria and guidelines for selecting candidates, prioritising internal candidates, and creating an open and productive work environment is essential. As noted, care is required to support (and avoid harming) diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. When it comes to engineering leadership positions, assessing technical skills and leadership capabilities is critical, and offering a clear progression framework can ensure a smooth transition into new roles. Ultimately, promoting from within can help create a strong and cohesive team, increase employee motivation and retention, and lead to overall organisational success.
