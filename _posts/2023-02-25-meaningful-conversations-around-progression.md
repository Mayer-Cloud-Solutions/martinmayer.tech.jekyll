#### Celebrate Successes

#### Recognise Opportunities to Improve

#### Talk About Aspirations

#### Frame the Practical with an Open Mind

#### Identify Progression Goals

#### Reference Your Own Journey
Examples and Analogies
Vulnerability
Uncertainty
Encourage them to look for answers rather than you providing them all


#### Make it count
The process will erode without meaningful, intentional action. You'll need a budget to grant pay rises and fund internal promotions. This can become political if the allocation for external and internal hires are separate so work this out as soon as you can. Developing a solid process will build confidence with your engineering team but also ensure the details are worked out with key stakeholders before you get to a review point.

#### Keep the Conversation Going
Regular 1:1s
Track progression events - example of 4As Kanban - provide Miro template

#### Frequent Review Points
Avoid annual big bang reviews and look to reward and promote the team throughout the year
