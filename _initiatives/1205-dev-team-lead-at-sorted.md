As the Developer Team Lead at Sorted, I had the opportunity to build the Carriers 1 team from scratch, consisting of 3 developers, 2 testers, and 2 BAs. My team was responsible for owning, maintaining, and developing carrier integrations, while continuously improving the related infrastructure. 🚚

I ensured that work was clear and detailed, with well-understood requirements, and supported the team in analyzing, developing, and testing to ensure that we delivered value and quality. 🛡️ As a Servant Leader, I worked with the team to help them achieve their personal goals and advance their careers. I also mentored developers as they integrated carriers with SortedPRO, while facilitating improvements to the carrier integration development approach and infrastructure. 📈

Working closely with product owners, I prioritized features for development and provided line management tasks for team members, including one-to-ones, holiday planning, and periodic reviews. I also ensured that the code quality was maintained and improved to produce testable, resilient carrier integrations. 🧰

Thanks to the hard work and dedication of the Carriers 1 team, we achieved several notable achievements. We developed a new end-to-end test framework to verify carrier integrations, integrated a new carrier required by a top-tier client, and eliminated technical debt to improve infrastructure and reduce the cost of carrier integrations. We also worked together to learn the fundamentals of Machine Learning, took part in a hack, and ran a training session for the wider team. I mentored two junior team members, both of whom went on to be promoted to IC2 (mid) level. 🤝

In addition to the team's accomplishments, I also initiated the internal integrations team from scratch, ensuring that there was not a single point of failure with our partners. I coached the team to perform optimally, integrating carriers alongside offshore teams while focusing on maintaining and improving existing integrations and infrastructure. I also assisted the Architecture team with technical knowledge of the carrier integrations and insights into the future of our carrier platform. 🚀
