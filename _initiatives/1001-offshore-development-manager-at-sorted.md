As the Offshore Development Manager at Sorted, I led several teams of skilled developers to build innovative software solutions for our clients. 🌟 Our team focused on leveraging the latest technology and development methodologies to deliver high-quality, scalable products. 🔝

🌍 Working in an offshore environment presented its challenges, but my team and I were able to overcome them by utilizing agile and lean development principles. 🚀 With regular communication and collaboration, we were able to build a culture of trust and transparency that allowed us to consistently meet our project goals and deadlines. 🏆

🙌 Throughout my time in the role, I worked closely with both internal and external stakeholders to ensure that our software solutions met the highest standards of quality and functionality. 💻 I also took on the responsibility of mentoring and coaching my team to help them reach their full potential as developers. 👥
