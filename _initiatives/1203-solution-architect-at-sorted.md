As a Solution Architect at Sorted, I played a critical role in ensuring that the technology solutions we provided to our clients aligned with their business objectives. 🔍 By reviewing and interpreting detailed business requirements, I worked closely with technology teams to recommend solutions that would improve our existing solutions architecture. 🧐

Within the agreed architecture, I defined and designed technology solutions that helped the business meet their objectives. 💻 Working closely with development teams, I provided guidance and support throughout the development, testing, release, deployment, and ongoing maintenance of these solutions, ensuring they were implemented as expected within agreed constraints. 🚀

In addition to designing and developing technology solutions, I also helped resolve technical incidents and problems as they arose. 🔧 My expertise in analyzing complex technical issues helped me to provide effective solutions and recommendations to ensure a smooth and seamless experience for our clients. 💪
