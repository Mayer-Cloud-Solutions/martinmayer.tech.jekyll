As an Engineering Manager at cinch Technology, I had the privilege of supporting 3 squads within the "Checkout and Value Add Products" tribe as the line manager of tech leads and individual contributor engineers. 🌟

💪 My primary focus was on coaching and empowering these high-performing teams to achieve their full potential while driving the people initiatives of a rapidly growing and dynamically re-teaming engineering department. I worked closely with tribe leaders to identify OKRs and clarify the tribe's mission and vision within cinch. 🔝

👥 As a leader, I was committed to the growth and development of my team members, supporting engineering team learning and development and leading initiatives around Engineer Progression, Goal Setting, and Feedback. I also contributed to the wider initiatives of the Engineering Management Community of Practice. 🚀

🙌 Together with my team, I set up productivity metrics to drive department and tribe key results, following the SPACE Framework. I mentored and coached high-performing senior engineers towards principal and tech lead roles, fostering a culture of excellence and continuous improvement.

👨‍💼 On a personal level, I facilitated the ongoing development of an Engineering Career Progression Framework and co-designed the processes around how cinch enables progression for the engineers they employ. I also coordinated the assessment of software for supporting career progression, objective setting, and feedback capture, including people success platform, Lattice, which was eventually selected.

💻 Additionally, I investigated new Learning & Development approaches, including assessing O'Reilly Online Learning and reviewing the other platforms in use at cinch, to ensure equality of access to learning resources and time. I supported the creation of a new tribe moving 2 squads and onboarding the engineers for a 3rd, and also planned and implemented a squad transition from contract to permanent engineers.
