As the Interim Head of Engineering at cinch Technology, I successfully led the engineering function of a tribe with 3 squads, one of which had recently formed, whilst the business found a permanent replacement for the role. 🌟

👨‍💼 In this capacity, I shaped the technical direction of the tribe, working closely with the rest of the tribe leadership on engineering concerns. I also served as a member of the Cross-tribe leadership team on various shared initiatives. 🔝

👥 Reporting directly to the Group Director of IT Engineering, I was responsible for overseeing the engineering team's performance and ensuring that all engineering initiatives aligned with cinch Technology's broader business objectives. 💻

🚀 Together, my team and I achieved notable successes, including reducing support load by decoupling components owned by other squads and developing tooling that could be used by engineers as well as the operational teams to view and edit data for customer orders. Additionally, we developed new processes to support incoming requests from stakeholders working with 3rd party suppliers/partners, enabling better communication in a challenging area of the business. 🙌

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Finally, I personally supported a reorganization of Product Engineering and the transition to a new tribe, streamlining processes and aiming to foster a more collaborative environment for my team. 💪
