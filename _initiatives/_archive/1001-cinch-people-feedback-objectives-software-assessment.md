At cinch, I coordinated the assessment of software to support career progression, objective setting, and feedback capture. I gathered a collective leaders from across cinch Technology including engineering managers, leaders and seniors from our Learning and Development team. Together we decided the scope we required.

We needed to identify a system for a cross-disciplined team of 400+ people, across cinch's 5 Product Engineering tribes and a number of supporting departments. We consulted the People team, Supplier Management and Procurement teams who work across the Constellation group, which cinch is part of.
